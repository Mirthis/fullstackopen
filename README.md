# FullStackOpen exercises
This repository contains the code I wrote to complete the exercises in the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) online course. I took the course in March 2022 so things may have changed since.

The code for the CI/CD modules can be found [here](https://github.com/Mirthis/full-stack-open-pokedex) and in the link in the repo's  Readme.

Some of the code has been initially developed in other repository to make deployment easier and has been copied over afterward. The original versions submitted to the course can be found  within [my Github public repositories](https://github.com/Mirthis).
